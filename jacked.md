Electric fuzz and sharp copper
infinite white geometric shapes
stretching out to the horizon

Impossible perfection
effortless generation
in bleeding edge sixteen kay
three hundred frames per second

This miasmic promised land
every byte of solace and discord
is seducing my senses
with its endless opportunity
and all I can taste is reality
