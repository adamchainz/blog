I love building things with Python, Django, HTTP, and Domain Driven Design.

I specialise in the design and implementation of large, distributed services. I have been writing software for over six years with tech companies in London and San Francisco.

I was awarded membership of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/) for my contribution to the community in 2015. ðŸ’š

- Python 3
- Django

- React
- Postgres
- Git
- HTTP

I have also worked with the following technologies in the past:

I really enjoy the following methodologies:

In my spare time I enjoy drinking coffee, drinking gin, traveling around the world, playing the boardgame Go, and learning Piano.
