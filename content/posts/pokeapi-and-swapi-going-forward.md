I've decided that I will no longer be actively developing [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co) and [SWAPI](https://swapi.co).

They will remain online for as long as I can finically support them. They are currently free thanks to the support of a few sponsors, but I will have to start paying the server cost in ~8 months time.

I will be accepting Pull Requests to update data and fix bugs.

As tools for teaching programming and API interaction they are brilliant. I want to continue to support that. However, actively developing open source projects is time consuming and requires commitment, and I do not have much time, or commitment to give. I appreciate everyone's support so far, and I hope to support people who pick up the mantle and take on active development going forward.
