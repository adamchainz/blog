here I float at the far forward end
of the uneven distribution of the future

electric cars that drive better than me
machines that solve my health problems quicker than any doctor

cameras that make a me professional photographer
social networks that learn how to feed off my pull-to-refresh addiction

websites that deliver to me within an hour
apps that turn my search for love into swipes-to-the-right

the future a brilliant hot edge fusing the silicon and the real into
normal life so seamlessly we forget it was even revolutionary at all
